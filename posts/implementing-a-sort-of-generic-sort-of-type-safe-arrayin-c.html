      <p>
        I've been using C for a project I've been working on, and one thing I find
        annoying are manually-managed arrays. Ever since watching
        <a href="https://youtu.be/YQs6IC-vgmo">Bjarne Stroustrup's talk on linked
        lists</a>, I try to avoid using those as much as possible. Therefore, I
        prefer using a container roughly equivalent to C++'s vector.</p>

      <p>
        The obvious thing to do here would be to use something like
        <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Arrays.html">
          glib's GArray type</a> or
        <a href="http://wolkykim.github.io/qlibc/doc/html/qvector_8c.html">
          qlibc's qvector type</a>. However, both APIs require using
        <code>sizeof</code> and are completely not-type-safe; it's easy to add a
        char to an array/vector of ints. This made me wonder: is it possible to
        implement a type-safe, generic array type in C?</p>

      <p>
        Now, I mean the C version of type-safe, which basically means that your
        compiler has to show either a warning or an error (probably if compiling with
        <code>-Werror</code>) when you try to append the wrong type to an array.</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      <i>Note that this implementation is not complete!</i> The most obvious issues
      are that you can't pop elements off an array, and it resizes itself with every
      new addition, which is (obviously!) slow.</p>

    <p>Also, it uses macros. If you're allergic to them...sucks to be you!</p>

    <p>The API is basically like:</p>

    <prism-js language="c">
List(int*) mylist = NULL; // NULL represents the empty list.
int a=1, b=2;
list_append(mylist, &a);
// We can get the first element of the list with l[0] and the length with list_len:
printf("%zu %d\n", list_len(mylist), *mylist[0]); // Prints 1 1.
list_append(mylist, &b);
printf("%zu %d %d\n", list_len(mylist), *mylist[0], *mylist[1]); // Prints 2 1 2.
list_free(mylist);
    </prism-js>

    <p>
      Note that I used the term <code>list</code>, not <code>array</code>, since I'm
      a Python nerd.</p>

    <p>
      I really like the fact that indexing a list is just <code>list[index]</code>,
      not something like <code>get_element(list, index)</code> or
      <code>list-&gt;array[index]</code>.</p>

    <p>
      Note that <i>this only supports lists of pointer types</i>. Don't try to use a
      non-pointer type. It either won't work, or it will work, but only on some
      platforms.</p>

    <p>
      The code is available at
      <a href="https://github.com/kirbyfan64/list">GitHub</a>.</p>

    <link-header id="boilerplate">Boilerplate</link-header>

    <prism-js language="c">
#ifndef LIST_H
#define LIST_H

...

#endif
    </prism-js>

    <p>Yeah, we all know what this is for! Joyous header files.</p>

    <p>Inside these header files is some more boilerplate:</p>

    <prism-js language="c">
#define list_cat2(a,b) a##b
#define list_cat(a,b) list_cat2(a,b)
#define list_var(b) list_cat(list_type_,list_cat(b,__LINE__))
    </prism-js>

    <p>
      This is just a way of creating anonymous, single-use variables inside a macro
      in order to avoid name clashes. Think Lisp's <code>gensym</code>.</p>

    <link-header id="basics">The basics</link-header>

    <prism-js language="c">
#define List(t) t*
    </prism-js>

    <p>
      <i>Now</i> the interesting stuff starts! This is just a macro to make uses
      of the list type look like generics, so that I can do stuff like
      <code>List(int*)</code>.</p>

    <prism-js language="c">
#define list_lenref(l) ((size_t*)l)[-1]
    </prism-js>

    <p>I think I need to explain a moment.</p>

    <p>
      Lists are represented by a pointer to a length of type <code>size_t</code>
      and the elements immediately after, like this:</p>

    <prism-js language="c">
struct my_list_type {
    size_t length;
    some_type my_array[size_here];
};
    </prism-js>

    <p>
      (Except that <code>my_array</code> can be of any size.) However, the list is
      a pointer to the array, after the length. Therefore, <code>list_lenref</code>
      (which gets the length of the list) needs to index BEFORE the given list to
      get the length.

    <p>Next is the definition of <code>list_len</code>:</p>

    <prism-js language="c">
#define list_len(l) (l?list_lenref(l):0)
    </prism-js>

    <p>
      This is just a wrapper macro around <code>list_lenref</code> to support
      getting the length of an empty list (<code>NULL</code>).</p>

    <link-header id="appending">Appending</link-header>

    <p>Now is my personal favorite part: the definition of <code>list_append</code>:

  <prism-js language="c">
#define list_append(l,x) do {\
    size_t list_var(len) = list_len(l);\
    l = realloc(l?((void*)l)-sizeof(size_t):NULL,\
                sizeof(void*)*(list_var(len)+1)+sizeof(size_t))+sizeof(size_t);\
    list_lenref(l) = list_var(len)+1;\
    l[list_lenref(l)-1] = x;\
} while (0)
  </prism-js>

    <p>
      This is definitely the biggest macro (and arguably the most important), so
      I'll explain it line-by-line:</p>

    <p>First, the length of the list is saved in an anonymous variable:</p>

    <prism-js language="c">
size_t list_var(len) = list_len(l);\
    </prism-js>

    <p>Next, the list is <code>realloc</code>'d:</p>

    <prism-js language="c">
l = realloc(l?((void*)l)-sizeof(size_t):NULL,\
            sizeof(void*)*(list_var(len)+1)+sizeof(size_t))+sizeof(size_t);\
    </prism-js>

    <p>
      This alone deserves explanation, too! The first argument to
      <code>realloc</code> is the block of memory to be resized. If the list is
      <code>NULL</code>, then <code>NULL</code> is passed to <code>realloc</code>.
      Otherwise, the size of the length is subtracted from the pointer to get the
      beginning of the allocated memory.</p>

    <p>
      The second argument is the size of the new memory block. This is the size of
      a pointer times the number of elements to be in the new list, which is just
      the old length plus 1.</p>

    <p>
      A <code>sizeof(size_t)</code> is then added to the result of the call to
      <code>realloc</code> to get a pointer to the elements.</p>

    <p>
      I didn't worry about <code>realloc</code> returning <code>NULL</code>, since
      this is just an example, and, in my use case, I'm calling a wrapper over
      <code>realloc</code> that aborts on out-of-memory errors.</p>

    <p>After all that, the length of the list is updated:</p>

    <prism-js language="c">
list_lenref(l) = list_var(len)+1;\
    </prism-js>

    <p>
      If you're wondering why I didn't just use <code>++list_lenref(l)</code>, it's
      because, if the list was empty before the append, the length will be
      uninitialized. Also, <code>list_lenref</code> is used instead of
      <code>list_len</code> because the latter is an rvalue because it handles
      empty lists, but we know the list is non-empty, and you can only assign to an
      l-value.</p>

    <p>And the new element is assigned:</p>

    <prism-js language="c">
l[list_lenref(l)-1] = x;\
    </prism-js>

    <p>
      All of this is wrapped in a <code>do/while</code> block to avoid
      <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/154138/2097780">surprising issues</a>.</p>

    <link-header id="freeing">Freeing the list</link-header>

    <p>Last of all comes freeing a list:</p>

    <prism-js language="c">
#define list_free(l) free(l?(void*)l-sizeof(size_t):NULL)
    </prism-js>

    <p>
      If the list is empty, then it just tries to free <code>NULL</code>, which
      does nothing. If the list is <i>not</i> empty, then
      <code>sizeof(size_t)</code> is subtracted to get the beginning of the list,
      and that is freed.

    <link-header id="closing">Closing notes (and problems)</link-header>

    <p>If you're wondering how the heck this is type-safe, consider:</p>

    <prism-js language="c">
List(int*) l;
char c=0;
list_append(l, &c);
    </prism-js>

    <p>If I try to compile this, my compiler (Clang) says:</p>

    <prism-js>
tst.c:13:5: warning: incompatible pointer types assigning to 'int *' from 'char *' [-Wincompatible-pointer-types]
    list_append(l, &c);
    ^              ~~
./list.h:16:25: note: expanded from macro 'list_append'
    l[list_lenref(l)-1] = x;\
                        ^
1 warning generated.
    </prism-js>

    <p>
      GCC 4.9 (which is admittedly an old version) gives a slightly less helpful
      but still informative warning:</p>

    <prism-js>
In file included from tst.c:5:0:
tst.c: In function ‘main’:
list.h:16:25: warning: assignment from incompatible pointer type
     l[list_lenref(l)-1] = x;\
                         ^
tst.c:13:5: note: in expansion of macro ‘list_append’
     list_append(l, &c);
     ^
    </prism-js>

    <p>Intel's doesn't show the macro expansion, but it still works:</p>

    <prism-js>
tst.c(13): warning #556: a value of type "char *" cannot be assigned to an entity of type "int *"
      list_append(l, &c);
      ^
    </prism-js>

    <p>
      You can see that the compiler always notices when something isn't right, and
      building with <code>-Werror</code> will prevent this from even compiling.</p>

    <p>As for problems with the implementation, there are a few:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The list is always resized on every append, like I mentioned above. This
        would be a trivial change that I just haven't done yet.
      <li>No popping from a list, which I also mentioned.</li>
      <li>
        No handling of a <code>realloc</code> failure. Again, I mentioned this
        above, too.</li>
      <li>
        Error messages can be big. Just try something like
        <code>list_append(some_nonexistent_variable, 0)</code> and you'll see what
        I mean. That gives a whopping 8 errors with Clang. GCC and Intel are much
        better here (they only show one), but you get the idea!
    </ul>

    <p>All in all, I still think this is a cool list implementation!</p>
