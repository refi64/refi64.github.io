  <div id="teaser">
    <p>
      Lately, there's been a large surge in new programming languages as projects
      such as <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> have been taking the
      spotlight and showing lots of promise. However, there are some programming
      languages few have heard of that deserve to be more popular. Here's a brief
      listing of some of my favorite languages that aren't common sights.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Nim</h2>

  <p>
    <a href="http://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a> is more popular than most languages on
    this list. It recently acquired
    <a href="http://forum.nim-lang.org/t/870">corporate backing from 3DICC</a> and
    is under very active development. Here's a factorial program in Nim:</p>

  <prism-js language="nim">
import unsigned, strutils

proc fac(n: int): uint64 =
  if n &lt;= 1:
    return n.uint64
  else:
    return n.uint64() * fac(n-1)

stdout.write "Number: "
var number = stdin.readLine.parseInt

if number &lt; 0:
  echo "Number must be greater than 0"
  quit QuitFailure

echo fac number
  </prism-js>

  <h2>Felix</h2>

  <p>
    <a href="http://felix-lang.org/">Felix</a> is an experimental programming
    language that covers most problems in a unique way. It's very functional and
    has great coroutine support, a nice threading system, and a grammar defined in
    user space (a.k.a. you can extend the grammar inside your own programs). You
    run your files just like a scripting language:</p>

  <prism-js>
$ flx my_prog.flx arg1 arg2
  </prism-js>

  <p>Here's a factorial program, this time in Felix:</p>

  <prism-js>
// Recursive factorial
fun fac(n: int) =>
    if n <= 1
    then n.ulong
    else n.ulong * fac(n-1)
;

// Read a number from stdin
print "Number: ";
var number = cstdin.readln.int;

if number < 0 do
    println "Number must be greater than 0";
    System::exit(1);
done;

// Print factorial
println $ fac number
  </prism-js>

  <h2>Myrddin</h2>

  <p>
    <a href="http://eigenstate.org/myrddin/">Myrddin</a> is, to quote the web
    page, "A toy with delusions of usefulness." Well, it's pretty useful to me.
    It's my new favorite low-level language (yes, above Rust). Following is yet
    another factorial program, but this one in, guess what, Myrddin:

  <prism-js>
use std
use bio

const fac = {n: int -&gt; uint64
    if n &lt;= 1
        -&gt; n castto (uint64)
    else
        -&gt; (n castto (uint64)) * fac(n-1)
    ;;
}

const main = {
    var stdin = bio.mkfile(0, bio.Rd)
    std.put("Number: ")
    match bio.readln(stdin)
    | `std.Some s:
        match std.intparse(std.strstrip(s))
        | `std.Some n:
            if n &lt; 0
                std.put("Number must be greater than 0\n")
                std.exit(1)
            ;;
            std.put("%l\n", fac(n))
        | `std.None:
            std.put("error parsing integer input\n")
            std.exit(1)
        ;;
    | `std.None:
        std.put("error reading input\n")
        std.exit(1)
    ;;
}
  </prism-js>

  <p>Notice the explicit error handling.</p>

  <h2>K</h2>

  <p>
    <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/11/14/22741/791">K</a> (and it's
    open source counterpart,
    <a href="https://github.com/kevinlawler/kona">Kona</a>) is a very unique
    language. Here's a factorial function in K:</p>

  <prism-js>
fac:{*/1+!x}
  </prism-js>

  <p>If that isn't readable enough, here's another version:</p>

  <prism-js>
fac:*/1+!:
  </prism-js>

  <p>You can now call it:</p>

  <prism-js>
fac[4]
  </prism-js>

  <p>
    K is actually surprisingly readable once you learn it...provided you don't
    get a nervous breakdown and blow your eyes out in the process. :)</p>

<h2>Objeck</h2>

  <p>
    <a href="http://www.objeck.org/">Objeck</a> is kind of how Java should've
    been. Here's a factorial in Objeck (the language has a factorial function
    built in, but this is a custom one):</p>

  <prism-js>
class Factorial {
    function : native : Factorial(n : Int) ~ Int {
        if (n <= 1) {
            return n;
        } else {
            return n * Factorial(n-1);
        };
    }

    function : Main(args : String[]) ~ Nil {
        "Number: "->Print();
        number := IO.Console->ReadString()->ToInt();
        if (number &lt; 0) {
            "Number must be greater than 0"->PrintLine();
            Runtime->Exit(1);
        };
        Factorial(number)->PrintLine();
    }
}
  </prism-js>

Objeck has no long/unsigned types, so I just used the basic <code>Int</code> type.

<h2>Final notes</h2>

  <p>
    I hope one of the languages here catches your eye. Just note that Myrddin and
    Felix are still VERY experimental.</p>
