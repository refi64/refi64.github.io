      <a href="http://wheel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Wheels</a> are the future
      of distribution. No more messy broken setup.py scripts or need for a
      compiler to build C extensions! Of course, this has a glaring issue: a Linux
      user can't build Wheels of their C extension for Windows. Unless, of course,
      you use <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>, install the MinGW
      compilers, define the compiler variables, etc. However, there is an easier
      way: <a href="http://www.appveyor.com">AppVeyor</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>
    AppVeyor uses a simple configuration file that uses YAML. Here is what the
    config file for your project might look like:</p>

  <prism-js language="yaml">
install:
  - ps: (new-object net.webclient).DownloadFile('https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py', 'C:/get-pip.py')
  - C:/Python34/python.exe C:/get-pip.py
  - C:/Python34/Scripts/pip.exe install wheel
build_script:
  - python setup.py build
test_script:
  - C:/Python34/Scripts/py.test
deploy_script:
  - python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload
  </prism-js>

  <p>
    It goes into a file named appveyor.yml. Here's what's going on, one piece at a
    time:</p>

  <prism-js language="yaml">
install:
  </prism-js>

  <p>The install section defines commands to run for installation.</p>

  <prism-js language="yaml">
- ps: (new-object net.webclient).DownloadFile('https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py', 'C:/get-pip.py')
- C:/Python34/python.exe C:/get-pip.py
  </prism-js>
  <p>
    These two lines install pip. The first uses PowerShell to download the install
    script; the second runs it.</p>

  <prism-js language="yaml">
- C:/Python34/Scripts/pip.exe install wheel
- C:/Python34/Scripts/pip.exe install pytest
  </prism-js>

  <p>
    The first line installs wheel. The second is optional; it just installs pytest
    (a unit testing framework). I put it here as an example of installing other
    packages with pip.</p>

  <prism-js language="yaml">
build_script:
  - C:/Python34/python.exe setup.py build
  </prism-js>

  <p>The commands to build your Python project go here.</p>

  <prism-js language="yaml">
test_script:
  - C:/Python34/Scripts/py.test
  </prism-js>

  <p>Whatever you do to run your project tests go here.</p>

  <prism-js language="yaml">
deploy_script:
  - python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload
  </prism-js>

  <p>This is the magic part; it runs bdist_wheel and uploads the result.</p>

  <p>
    That's it! Pretty simple, no? Now, you can build Windows binary wheels
    easily.</p>

  <p>
    <b>EDIT:</b> Someone pointed out in the comments that I completely ignored
    PyPI authentication. Luckily, it's a simple addition.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        Go to your AppVeyor account and click your username in the top-right
        corner. Select "Encrypt Data" in the menu that appears.</p>
      <img src="http://s5.postimg.org/lmtn7ucsn/appveyor_encrypt.png"
           style="max-width: 327px;"></li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Type your password in the box and click "Encrypt". AppVeyor should give
        you an encrypted value. Copy it.</p>
      <img src="http://s5.postimg.org/50c2yrjuv/appveyor_encrypt_win.png"
           style="max-width: 869px;"></li>

    <li>
      <p>Now, add this to the end of appveyor.yml:</p>

      <prism-js language="yaml">
environment:
  password:
    secure: <value>
      </prism-js>

      <p>
        replaing <code>value</code> with the value you copied from the Encrypt
        Data page. Then, change the deploy_script part to read this:</p>

      <prism-js language="yaml">
deploy_script:
     - "echo [pypi] &gt; %USERPROFILE%\\.pypirc"
     - "echo username: user &gt;&gt; %USERPROFILE%\\.pypirc"
     - "echo password: %password% &gt;&gt; %USERPROFILE%\\.pypirc"
     - python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload
      </prism-js>
  </ol>
