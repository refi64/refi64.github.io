      Let's have an imaginary scenario: you're trying to make a library that has a
      special function, <code>myfunc</code>. Now, this functions needs to have two
      possible ways to invoke it. One way takes one int parameter, the other takes
      two. Here's how you might do that in C++:</p>
  </div>

  <prism-js language="cpp">
    void myfunc(int);
    void myfunc(int, int);
  </prism-js>

  <p>C doesn't have a way to do this. You'll often see code like this:</p>

  <prism-js language="c">
    void myfunc_1(int);
    void myfunc_2(int, int);
  </prism-js>

  <p>
    However, this <i>can</i> be implemented, albeit in a slightly convoluted way,
    using a very controversial tool: the C preprocessor.</p>
