      <b>NOTE: 2016-5-22:</b> In retrospect a year later, this post was absolutely
      NOT well-written. There are better articles online that aim at giving the
      same point, but, you know, actually <i>give</i> it. Feel free to read this,
      but try to ignore the fact that I didn't write it too well. And I completely
      forgot about the phrase "silver bullet".</p>

    <p>
      I like functional programming. Being a big fan of Python and C++, it took a
      while to get used to functional languages like Haskell and Felix (my
      personal favorite FP language). I started out with <i>Learn You a Haskell for
      Great Good!</i> and then started toying with OCaml and Felix. I stuck with
      Felix and ditched OCaml because I just didn't like it.</p>

    <p>
      However, it isn't the solution to the world's issues. People used to think
      OOP was the solution to everything. They started shoving every freaking
      thing on earth in a class and adding useless methods. Then they realized
      that Java sucked. Now, everyone seems to think that FP is going to take over
      the world. I disagree. Why?</p>

    Certain programs are easier to extend with OOP</link-header>

  <p>
    I <i>love</i> Norman Ramsey's Stack Overflow answers because they're from a
    functional programming advocate who knows that it's not the solution to all
    issues. Take his answer to
    <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2079678/2097780">
      Functional programming vs Object Oriented programming</a>. Basically, OOP
    languages are good when the operations on things stay the same, and you just
    add new things. Functional languages are good when the things stay the same
    and you're constantly adding new operations.</p>

  <p>
    It has bitten me several times in functional languages before when I forgot to
    update a pattern match someone to make up for a new field in my algebraic data
    type. Same thing for OOP: I've had problems when adding new
    algorithms/transformations on OOP objects and end up forgetting something
    somewhere, only to get a 200-template error message about instantiating some
    ABC somewhere (C++) or a <code>NotImplementedError</code> (Python). Neither
    paradigm solves both issues.</p>

  <p>
    IMO, build systems are good with OOP. You tend to add support for, say, extra
    C++ compilers more than you add a new compilation command (how many different
    ways to do the same thing are there?).</p>

  <link-header id="perf">It can be hard to predict performance</link-header>

  <p>
    This is more an issue with lazy languages (e.g. Haskell) and tracing JITs
    (like PyPy) than strict languages (like C++, Felix, and ML).</p>

  <p>
    Basically, it's hard to predict how a program will perform. This innocent
    function:</p>

  <prism-js language="haskell">
f = foldl1 (+)
  </prism-js>

  <p>
    will explode if given a list too long; the stack will be exhausted. Or it will
    just take forever. You need to use <code>foldl1'</code> in that case, which is
    strict.</p>

  <p>In imperative programming, this isn't even a problem:</p>

  <prism-js language="cpp">
std::vector&lt;int&gt; v(10000000, 1);
std::cout &lt;&lt; std::accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), 0, std::plus&lt;int&gt;{}) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  </prism-js>

  <p>I had this code in all:</p>

  <p>Haskell:</p>

  <prism-js language="haskell">
f = foldl1 (+)

main = print . f $ replicate 10000000 1
  </prism-js>

  <note-card>
    I know about <code>sum</code>, but using it distracts from the point of this
    whole post.</note-card>

  <p>C++:</p>

  <prism-js language="cpp">
#include &lt;functional&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector&lt;int&gt; v(10000000, 1);
    cout &lt;&lt; accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), 0, plus&lt;int&gt;()) &lt;&lt; endl;
}
  </prism-js>

  <p>
    The Haskell version gives a stack overflow after 1.7 seconds. Changing
    <code>foldl1</code> to <code>foldl1'</code> fixes it, but it still takes
    0.184s. C++ version? 0.022s.</p>

  <p>
    Now, I'm not saying that Haskell is slow; it can actually be quite fast. I'm
    just saying that it can be hard to predict performance, where your stack will
    explode, or where you can blow through several gigs of RAM.</p>

  <p>
    It's worth saying again that this is only really bad for lazy languages, so
    Felix and OCaml shouldn't suffer from it as badly. Rust also doesn't suffer
    from it; the program I wrote took 0.04s.</p>

  <p>
    <b>EDIT:</b> As @kuribas pointed out in the comments, the Haskell example
    seems to be inferred to use unbounded integers. Let's try using bounded
    ones:</p>

  <prism-js language="haskell">
f :: [Int] -&gt; Int
f = foldl1' (+)
  </prism-js>

  <p>
    This finishes in 1.7s on my (not-too-fast) computer. He also pointed out that
    using <code>Data.Vector</code> instead made it faster than the C++
    version:</p>

  <prism-js language="haskell">
import qualified Data.Vector as V

f :: V.Vector Int -&gt; Int
f = V.foldl1' (+)

main = print . f $ V.replicate 10000000 1
  </prism-js>

  <p>This actually took a whopping 1.08s on my laptop. Ouch!</p>

  <p>
    <b>EDIT 2: 2016-5-22:</b> Again looking at this a year later, I'm pretty
    sure I made a stupid mistake and didn't compile any of the code with
    optimizations. Wow, it's amazing how stupid you feel sometimes looking at
    yourself a year in the past...</p>

  <link-header id="magic">It's not magic</link-header>

  <p>
    I keep saying it: it's not going to make everyone happy, create world peace,
    make Windows actually work, and make you 6 meals a day. I like FP for certain
    situations. Haskell is fun (and makes you feel smart!), Felix is just
    awesome, and Rust is neat.</p>

  <p>
    Same thing goes for OOP. I'm not going to try to tackle those issues because
    20k blog posts already have.</p>

  <p>
    I'm not bashing FP; I'm just saying it isn't perfect. Everyone loves it right
    now. In 20 years, someone's going to find something wrong. Then everyone's
    going to hate it and start using
    <a href="http://evincarofautumn.blogspot.com/2012/02/why-concatenative-programming-matters.html">
      concatenative programming</a>. Until everyone realizes it sucks and starts
    using the true source of happiness:
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">
      tape-based programming</a>.</p>

  <link-header id="mix">What about mixing them?</link-header>

  <p>
    This is hard. In the end, one is always going to be better supported than the
    other.</p>

  <p>
    For instance, you can write FP-like programs in Python. But Python has a rich
    object system, not a pattern-matching system. Therefore, Python seems to lean
    towards OOP. Same thing for C++.</p>

  <p>
    Felix has objects, but they end up compiling down to closures. In reality,
    Felix leans towards FP.</p>

  <p>
    Scala ends up leaning towards OOP, if not just because most of the Java
    libraries you'll end up using from Scala use classes.</p>

  <p>
    Some languages that claim that they use FP, like K, seem to be more
    procedural in nature, too.</p>

  <p>
    Again, there's no perfect answer. If programming was a solved problem, I'm not
    sure what would happen, because we haven't reached that point, and we
    probably never will.</p>

  <p>
    Also, I'm not saying that moving forward like this is bad. Imagine what would
    happen if we were still writing everything in COBOL and Fortran!</p>

  <p>
    But it's just not all cut out. Trying to mix them perfectly doesn't work out,
    either...</p>
