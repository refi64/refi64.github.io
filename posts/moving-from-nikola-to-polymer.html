      <p>
        We've all done those things before. You know it's a horrible idea, but it
        just sounds <i>so</i> cool that you can't resist.</p>

      <p>
        Well, that's why I decided to move away from Nikola (which is awesome BTW)
        and roll a home-made website using Polymer and the paper components.</p>
    </div>

    <link-header id="why">But...why?</link-header>

    <p>To be honest, I have absolutely no idea.</p>

    <p>
      I had been toying with Polymer, and I loved it. However, it seemed like there
      was nothing for me to use it on. Then I got the idea: why not move away from
      my perfectly good, fast, stable static site generator and rewrite the whole
      site by myself?</p>

    <p>
      Also, I was bored and curious. I dislike "black boxes"; if I don't know how
      something works, I get frustrated easily.</p>

    <p>In addition, where's the fun in <i>not</i> re-inventing the wheel?</p>

    <link-header id="easy">The easy parts</link-header>

    <p>
      Some stuff was pretty easy. For instance, I'm using
      <a href="http://prismjs.com/">Prism</a> for syntax highlighting and
      <a href="https://sharebutton.co/">share-button</a> for sharing stuff. I stuck
      with Disqus for commenting.</p>

    <link-header id="hard">The hard/messy parts (mostly AJAX)</link-header>

    <p>Well, of course there were some...err...<i>complications</i>...</p>


    <p>
      In particular, notice the <a href="/index.html">index page</a>. The whole
      thing is automatically-generated. With AJAX.</p>

    <p>
      In the root of the website is
      <a href="/posts.json"><code>posts.json</code></a>. This contains a list of
      <i>all</i> the posts. The source code of <code>index.html</code> uses AJAX to
      fetch the list of posts, then proceeds to again use AJAX (fun stuff) in order
      to fetch the post.</p>

    <p>
      Now, the fetched post is already in DOM nodes, so I can use normal DOM
      querying to fetch the <code>div</code> with the id <code>teaser</code> and
      generate a teaser from it.</p>

    <link-header id="weird">The really weird parts</link-header>

    <p>
      Tags use a similar mechanism of getting the posts via AJAX and querying the
      <code>site-tags</code> element. However, for some weird as heck reason, on my
      computer, clicking <code>any</code> link that leads to a totally different
      page, it'll just take you back to <code>tags.html</code>. Refresing fixes the
      issue. No clue what the heck is wrong...</p>

    <link-header id="stupid">The stupid mistakes</link-header>

    <p>So I don't usually do <i>that</i> much web development:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        I consistently blew my brain out trying to figure out why elements weren't
        showing. Because I changed the opening tag of another element and forgot to
        change the closing tag. Resulting in it never being closed.</li>

      <li>
        I code too much Python. Iny my JS code, I tried adding two arrays together
        with <code>+</code>...</li>

      <li>
        Random other stuff. Mostly stuff related to styling/AJAX. JS is <i>not</i>
        my forte.</li>
    </ul>

    <link-header id="closing">Closing thoughts</link-header>

    <p>
      Normally, I dislike websites that use JavaScript a lot. But I just couldn't
      resist the idea of trying to do this whole thing without a static site
      generator. I mean, it <i>mostly</i> works...</p>

    <p>
      Note that, at the moment, the RSS feed still no longer works. Not quite sure
      what to do about that yet.</p>

    <p>Oh, and also:</p>
