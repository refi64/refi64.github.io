      <b>DISCLAIMER:</b>
      <i>
        This is a satirical post. If your name is mentioned in a diminishing way,
        don't be insulted; I insult myself a few times throughout the post. Also,
        I like some of the projects I made fun of, including C++, JavaScript,
        Kotlin, Nim, Fbuild, and plenty of others. Again, this is
        satirical.</i></p>
    <p>
      A farmer couldn't figure out how to maintain his web servers, so he gave it
      to his animals. However, they simply couldn't agree on what tools to use.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Horse: We should write it in PHP.</p>

  <p>Cow: No; Ruby on Rails is better.</p>

  <p>
    Duck: Forget about Rails; we need a native HTML+JS (or TypeScript) solution
    using React.js components.</p>

  <p>
    Bee (various non-farm animals joined in the conversation): But Polymer is so
    much better!</p>

  <p>Duck: And slower.</p>

  <p>Bee: That was before 1.0.</p>

  <p>Cow: But JavaScript is unmaintainable!</p>

  <p>Leech: Use TypeScript.</p>

  <p>Horse: Microsoft is evil.</p>

  <p>Cow: With TypeScript, we need to compile our code. What about PyPy.js?</p>

  <p>
    Fish: Then we end up with a 2 hour startup time. That thing blows through
    10 MB of data!</p>

  <p>Bee: Just use TypeScript with a build system like Grunt.</p>

  <p>Leech: Ugh! Grunt is so last-gen! Use Gulp.</p>

  <p>Ant: Or Google's Anvil.</p>

  <p>Duck: Anvil? Sounds painful.</p>

  <p>Pig: What about writing the site in Nim? It has a JS backend.</p>

  <p>Horse: Python is evil, and therefore Nim is evil.</p>

  <p>Leech: Nim's creator called me a Leech!</p>

  <p>Pig: <i>YOU ARE A LEECH!!</i></p>

  <p>Bee: We can use Java+GWT.</p>

  <p>Duck: Or just Java.</p>

  <p>Ant: Eh, no one likes Java; how about Scala?</p>

  <p>Horse: Scala takes forever to compile, is slow, and is therefore evil.</p>

  <p>Pig: We can use Kotlin or Groovy or...</p>

  <p>
    Cow: But now we're back to the TypeScript problem: we need to compile our
    code.</p>

  <p>Fish: Use Maven.</p>

  <p>Ant: HA! We're not suicidal! Gradle is so much better.</p>

  <p>Deer: And Buck.</p>

  <p>Horse: Buck has Android build rules and is therefore evil.</p>

  <p>Bee: All those suck! Just use Fbuild.</p>

  <p>
    Duck: The Scala builder in Fbuild has been broken for ages, and no one there
    is seemingly smart enough to fix it.</p>

  <p>
    Leech: At HLUYTSWE (Magic Engineering Company Inc.), they use a bunch of
    shell scripts layered under Shake using kdb to store hashes and redo
    for...</p>

  <p>Horse: Shell scripts are evil.</p>

  <p>Fish: *sigh* Whatever. How about C++?</p>

  <p>Ant: Still not suicidal.</p>

  <p>Cow: If we use C++, we need another build system. Again.</p>

  <p>Fish: Fbuild.</p>

  <p>Horse: Make.</p>

  <p>Ant: CMake+Ninja.</p>

  <p>Fish: Bazel.</p>

  <p>Leech: Autotools.</p>

  <p>
    Cow: Autotools == pain, horror, and lengthy config times. CMake is faster.</p>

  <p>Horse: CMake uses macros and is therefore evil.</p>

  <p>Cow: But CMake has a Ninja generator!</p>

  <p>Fish: Then use GN. Or Gyp.</p>

  <p>Duck: Gyp is ugly and complicated.</p>

  <p>
    Pig: Ninja was written for Chromium. I heard that they track the type of oven
    you have and zap you if you boil peanuts. We should use C++ with
    Clang+Tup.</p>

  <p>
    Horse: Clang is sponsored by Apple and is therefore evil. The creator of Tup
    has a secret alliance with Mordor; therefore, Tup is evil.</p>

  <p>
    Ant: GCC is better. Their license is the one true way. Besides, what about
    writing the site in Crystal or Felix?</p>

  <p>
    Horse: Richard Stallman's beard is too long; therefore, GCC is evil. Crystal
    is written by a sword-wielding apple and is therefore evil. Felix is written
    by someone who can't shut their mouth for over 5 minutes and is therefore
    evil.</p>

  <p>
    Leech: The MIT Expat license is much better than the GPL. What about Rust?</p>

  <p>
    Ant: Again, not suicidal. The sheer number of errors related to
    borrowing/stealing/pillaging gives me heartburn.</p>

  <p>Horse: Rust...</p>

  <p>Everyone: TO YOU EVERYTHING IS EVIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

  <p>
    Bee: C++ still has better IDE support than the other languages; we can use
    Visual Studio.</p>

  <p>Horse: Visual Studio... <i>gets kicked by pig</i></p>

  <p>Duck: Nah, Vim is the best editor.</p>

  <p>
    Pig: Emacs is better. I can type <code>C-f M-d shoot C-s-h-l-f-e</code> and
    get a free hamburger.</p>

  <p>Duck: Vim too: <code>ahsJGT12$@/ghns</code>.</p>

  <p>
    Leech: Forget about it. I know the best language to use: K. Someone actually
    wrote a BF interpreter in a few lines of code!</p>

  <p>
    Pig: The creator of K has no concept of code maintainability, and the person
    who wrote that interpreter is an alien from Pluto.</p>

  <p>
    Fish: We can use Elm, which compiles to JS. Or we can use Haskell. I
    momentarily forgot how superior purely functional programming is...</p>

  <p>Horse: <i>opens his mouth and gets kicked by Duck</i>.</p>

  <p>
    Cow: The entire database can be a monadic applicative functorical set-based
    polymorphic monomorphic mathical editorial purely functional SHA1-based data
    structure.</p>

  <p>Leech: What about Python?</p>

  <p>Bee: Booooo to indentation syntax.</p>

  <p>Fish: How about Go?</p>

  <p>Ant: I told you guys! Not suicidal!</p>

  <p>
    Leech: Someone released a study proving that using Go makes you grow excess
    armpit hair.</p>

  <p>Pig: Go tracks you steps and zaps you if you kick a gofer.</p>

  <p>Horse: WE WILL GO TO THE FARMER AND ASK!</p>

  <p>Ant, Bee, Leech: We'll go first!</p>

  <p>
    The ant, bee, and leech went the farmer, who freaked out by the sudden
    showing of unwanted creatures and drowned them all in alcohol.</p>

  <p>Fish: Why don't you think they've come back?</p>

  <p>Horse: They are evil. We shall go next.</p>

  <p>
    The horse, cow, duck, fish, pig, went to the farmer. Now, the farmer had been
    on a vegetarian diet. When he saw all these animals, he want haywire, shot
    them, and had horse-beef-duck-fish-pork stew for dinner</p>

  <p>
    However, the farmer realized he still needed to fix his web site, so he paid
    someone on the side of the street 5 bucks. Now he has a website that handles
    0.04 requests per second, and he cannot find anyone who knows how to maintain
    the INTERCAL+BF web app the person wrote.</p>

  <p>
    <b>Motto:</b> There's supposed to be a motto? Uhh...how about "If you don't
    stop debating, you'll get either drowned in alcohol or eaten?" Yeah, that's a
    good one! :)</p>
