    <p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong> <em>This is a satirical post. If your name is mentioned in a diminishing way, don't be insulted; I insult myself a few times throughout the post. Also, I like some of the projects I made fun of, including C++, JavaScript, Kotlin, Nim, Fbuild, and plenty of others. Again, this is satirical.</em></p>
<p>A farmer couldn't figure out how to maintain his web servers, so he gave it to his animals. However, they simply couldn't agree on what tools to use.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<p>Horse: We should write it in PHP.</p>
<p>Cow: No; Ruby on Rails is better.</p>
<p>Duck: Forget about Rails; we need a native HTML+JS (or TypeScript) solution using React.js components.</p>
<p>Bee (various non-farm animals joined in the conversation): But Polymer is so much better!</p>
<p>Duck: And slower.</p>
<p>Bee: That was before 1.0.</p>
<p>Cow: But JavaScript is unmaintainable!</p>
<p>Leech: Use TypeScript.</p>
<p>Horse: Microsoft is evil.</p>
<p>Cow: With TypeScript, we need to compile our code. What about PyPy.js?</p>
<p>Fish: Then we end up with a 2 hour startup time. That thing blows through 10 MB of data!</p>
<p>Bee: Just use TypeScript with a build system like Grunt.</p>
<p>Leech: Ugh! Grunt is so last-gen! Use Gulp.</p>
<p>Ant: Or Google's Anvil.</p>
<p>Duck: Anvil? Sounds painful.</p>
<p>Pig: What about writing the site in Nim? It has a JS backend.</p>
<p>Horse: Python is evil, and therefore Nim is evil.</p>
<p>Leech: Nim's creator called me a Leech!</p>
<p>Pig: <em>YOU ARE A LEECH!!</em></p>
<p>Bee: We can use Java+GWT.</p>
<p>Duck: Or just Java.</p>
<p>Ant: Eh, no one likes Java; how about Scala?</p>
<p>Horse: Scala takes forever to compile, is slow, and is therefore evil.</p>
<p>Pig: We can use Kotlin or Groovy or...</p>
<p>Cow: But now we're back to the TypeScript problem: we need to compile our code.</p>
<p>Fish: Use Maven.</p>
<p>Ant: HA! We're not suicidal! Gradle is so much better.</p>
<p>Deer: And Buck.</p>
<p>Horse: Buck has Android build rules and is therefore evil.</p>
<p>Bee: All those suck! Just use Fbuild.</p>
<p>Duck: The Scala builder in Fbuild has been broken for ages, and no one there is seemingly smart enough to fix it.</p>
<p>Leech: At HLUYTSWE (Magic Engineering Company Inc.), they use a bunch of shell scripts layered under Shake using kdb to store hashes and redo for...</p>
<p>Horse: Shell scripts are evil.</p>
<p>Fish: *sigh* Whatever. How about C++?</p>
<p>Ant: Still not suicidal.</p>
<p>Cow: If we use C++, we need another build system. Again.</p>
<p>Fish: Fbuild.</p>
<p>Horse: Make.</p>
<p>Ant: CMake+Ninja.</p>
<p>Fish: Bazel.</p>
<p>Leech: Autotools.</p>
<p>Cow: Autotools == pain, horror, and lengthy config times. CMake is faster.</p>
<p>Horse: CMake uses macros and is therefore evil.</p>
<p>Cow: But CMake has a Ninja generator!</p>
<p>Fish: Then use GN. Or Gyp.</p>
<p>Duck: Gyp is ugly and complicated.</p>
<p>Pig: Ninja was written for Chromium. I heard that they track the type of oven you have and zap you if you boil peanuts. We should use C++ with Clang+Tup.</p>
<p>Horse: Clang is sponsored by Apple and is therefore evil. The creator of Tup has a secret alliance with Mordor; therefore, Tup is evil.</p>
<p>Ant: GCC is better. Their license is the <em>one</em> true way. Besides, what writing the site in Crystal or Felix?</p>
<p>Horse: Richard Stallman's beard is too long; therefore, GCC evil. Crystal is written by a sword-wielding apple and is therefore evil. Felix is written by someone who can't shut their mouth for over 5 minutes and is therefore evil.</p>
<p>Leech: The MIT Expat license is much better than the GPL. What about Rust?</p>
<p>Ant: Again, not suicidal. The sheer number of errors related to borrowing/stealing/pillaging gives me heartburn.</p>
<p>Horse: Rust...</p>
<p>Everyone: TO YOU EVERYTHING IS EVIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Bee: C++ still has better IDE support than the other languages; we can use Visual Studio.</p>
<p>Horse: Visual Studio... <em>gets kicked by pig</em></p>
<p>Duck: Nah, Vim is the best editor.</p>
<p>Pig: Emacs is better. I can type <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C-f</span> <span class="pre">M-d</span> shoot <span class="pre">C-s-h-l-f-e</span></tt> and get a free hamburger.</p>
<p>Duck: Vim too: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ahsJGT12$@/ghns</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Leech: Forget about it. I know the best language to use: K. Someone actually wrote a BF interpreter in a few lines of code!</p>
<p>Pig: The creator of K has no concept of code maintainability, and the person who wrote that interpreter is an alien from Pluto.</p>
<p>Fish: We can use Elm, which compiles to JS. Or we can use Haskell. I momentarily forgot how superior purely functional programming is...</p>
<p>Horse: <em>opens his mouth and gets kicked by Duck</em>.</p>
<p>Cow: The entire database can be a monadic applicative functorical set-based polymorphic monomorphic mathical editorial purely functional SHA1-based data structure.</p>
<p>Leech: What about Python?</p>
<p>Bee: Booooo to indentation syntax.</p>
<p>Fish: How about Go?</p>
<p>Ant: I told you guys! Not suicidal!</p>
<p>Leech: Someone released a study proving that using Go makes you grow excess armpit hair.</p>
<p>Pig: Go tracks you steps and zaps you if you kick a gofer.</p>
<p>Horse: WE WILL GO TO THE FARMER AND ASK!</p>
<p>Ant, Bee, Leech: We'll go first!</p>
<p>The ant, bee, and leech went the farmer, who freaked out by the sudden showing of unwanted creatures and drowned them all in alcohol.</p>
<p>Fish: Why don't you think they've come back?</p>
<p>Horse: They are evil. We shall go next.</p>
<p>The horse, cow, duck, fish, pig, went to the farmer. Now, the farmer had been on a vegetarian diet. When he saw all these animals, he want haywire, shot them, and had horse-beef-duck-fish-pork stew for dinner</p>
<p>However, the farmer realized he still needed to fix his web site, so he paid someone on the side of the street 5 bucks. Now he has a website that handles 0.04 requests per second, and he cannot find anyone who knows how to maintain the INTERCAL+Brainf**k web app the person wrote.</p>
<p><strong>Motto</strong>: There's supposed to be a motto? Uhh...how about "If you don't stop debating, you'll get either drowned in alcohol or eaten?" Yeah, that's a good one! :)</p>
