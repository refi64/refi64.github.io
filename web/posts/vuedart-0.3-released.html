      <p>
        After a few months of quiet, I'm super proud to announce VueDart 0.3! Unlike
        0.2 (which should've been a minor release, except I wasn't thinking clearly),
        0.3 brings an enormous amount of new features, bugfixes, and more.</p>
    </div>

    <link-header id="new">New features</link-header>

    <link-header small id="cli">The VueDart CLI</link-header>

    <p>
      One of my favorite new features is the VueDart CLI. Installable via
      <code>pub global activate vue2_cli</code>, this supports both creating projects
      from predefined templates <i>and</i> a basic migration tool (currently
      supporting the 0.2 -&gt; 0.3 migration).</p>

    <p>Now, creating a new project is as easy as:</p>

    <pygments>
$ vuedart create my-project --aspen
    </pygments>

    <p>(Aspen is covered below.)</p>

    <p>Migrating from VueDart 0.2? Just run:</p>

    <pygments>
$ vuedart migrate . pubspec.yaml lib/* any_other_files_to_migrate
    </pygments>

    <p>I actually used the migration tool to update this website's components!</p>

    <link-header small id="aspen">Aspen: A Dart-oriented asset acker</link-header>

    <p>
      As I started to create more VueDart projects, I found myself often having to
      either depend on a CDN for all my JS dependencies, or manually concatenate
      them all together in my build scripts. In order to alleviate this problem, I
      created <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/aspen">Aspen</a>! Aspen is
      by no means VueDart-specific, but it was designed with VueDart in mind.</p>

    <p>Here's an example <code>aspen.yml</code> used by this website:</p>

    <pygments class="yaml">
targets:
  default:
    outputs:
      default: web/dist/pack.js

    assets:
    - dev: node_modules/vue/dist/vue.js
      prod: node_modules/vue/dist/vue.min.js
    - dev: node_modules/vue-material/dist/vue-material.debug.js
      prod: node_modules/vue-material/dist/vue-material.debug.js
    - dev: node_modules/better-share-button/dist/share-button.js
      prod: node_modules/better-share-button/dist/share-button.min.js
    - dev: node_modules/whendefined/dist/whendefined.js
      prod: node_modules/whendefined/dist/whendefined.min.js
    - web/analytics.js

    - name: pygments-css
      default: web/dist/pygments.css
    - name: vue-material-css
      default: node_modules/vue-material/dist/vue-material.css
    - name: share-button-css
      dev: node_modules/better-share-button/dist/share-button.css
      prod: node_modules/better-share-button/dist/share-button.min.css
    - name: material-icons-css
      default: node_modules/material-design-icons/iconfont/material-icons.css
    </pygments>

    <p>
      Now I just run <code>aspen</code> for development builds and
      <code>aspen -m prod</code> for production builds, and it all "just works".</p>

    <p>
      Aspen is now the "official" way of handling assets for VueDart projects.
      As shown above in the CLI examples, passing <code>--aspen</code> to the VueDart
      CLI will generate an Aspen-and-npm/yarn-based project instead of generating
      one that depends on CDNs.</p>

    <link-header small id="scoped">Scoped styles</link-header>

    <p>
      Scoped styles are now supported in your components, via the
      <a href="pub.dartlang.org/packages/scopify">scopify</a> package. Just toss
      this into your templates:</p>

    <pygments class="html">
&lt;template vuedart&gt;
  ...
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;style scoped&gt;
  p {
    background-color: purple;
  }
&lt;style&gt;
    </pygments>

    <link-header small id="plugins">Support for the VueMaterial and VueRouter plugins</link-header>

    <p>
      VueDart now includes built-in support for VueRouter and VueMaterial. Both are
      described in further detail in the documentation, but the short version is that
      you can now use VueRouter from VueDart, and you can now access VueMaterial
      component methods without needing to shell out to JS.</p>

    <p>The syntax looks much like JavaScript:</p>

    <pygments class="dart">
final router = new VueRouter(routes: [
  new VueRoute(path: '/item/:id', component: #RootComponent, children: [
    new VueRoute(path: 'info', component: #ChildComponent),
  ]),
  new VueRoute(path: '/named-view/:id', components: {
    'root': #RootComponent,
  }),
]);
    </pygments>

    <p>
      In order to access <code>$router</code> and <code>$route</code>, you need to
      use the <code>VueRouterMixin</code> mixin. Again, this is explained further
      in the documentation.</p>

    <p>
      Part of the new router support also includes the ability to define an unnamed
      component (which is why <a href="#name-positional">this breaking change</a> had
      to occur).</p>

    <link-header small id="mixins">Mixins and watchers</link-header>

    <p>Mixins are supported now, too. Here's an example:</p>

    <pygments class="dart">
@VueMixin()
abstract class TodoMixin {
  @method
  String capitalize(String thing) =&gt; thing.toUpperCase();
}

@VueComponent(name: 'my-component', template: '&lt;&lt;', mixins: const [TodoMixin])
class ShowName extends VueComponentBase with TodoMixin {
  // ...
}
    </pygments>

    <p>Note that at the moment, only components can use mixins.</p>

    <p>Watchers work now, too:</p>

    <pygments class="dart">
@watch('my-value')
void watchMyValue() =&gt; print('Watching my-value!');
    </pygments>

    <link-header small id="instance">
      <code>$emit</code>, <code>$nextTick</code>, and more instance properties/methods
      </link-header>

    <p>
      As stated in the title, you can now emit events, and use <code>$on</code>,
      <code>$off</code>, and <code>$once</code>:</p>

    <pygments class="dart">
$emit('my-custom-event', ['some arg', 'some other arg']);

$on('something', (event) {
  print(123);
});
    </pygments>

    <p><code>$nextTick</code> also works:</p>

    <pygments class="dart">
$nextTick().then(() =&gt; {
  print('In \$nextTick callback!');
});
    </pygments>

    <p>Several others work now, too.</p>

    <link-header small id="config">
      Support for setting Vue config options via <code>VueConfig</code></link-header>

    <p>
      <code>VueConfig</code> is making its debut with VueDart 0.3, though for now
      all it supports is assigning ignoredElements:</p>

    <pygments>
VueConfig.ignoredElements = ['my-element'];
    </pygments>

    <link-header small id="rewriting">
      HTML files won't be completely reformatted by the transformer</link-header>

    <p>
      A minor change, but a useful one nonetheless. Before, any HTML files would be
      completely reformatted when they were run through the transformer, due to the
      way it worked. This was revamped, so now the formatting will be preserved.</p>

    <link-header small id="renaming">Better automated script path renaming</link-header>

    <p>
      By default, VueDart will automatically change your unpkg script tags when
      building in release mode. For instance, this:</p>

    <pygments class="html">
&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/vue"&gt;
    </pygments>

    <p>will be transformed into this:</p>

    <pygments class="html">
&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/vue/dist/vue.min.js"&gt;
    </pygments>

    <p>
      Now this will be done to any Vue imports, not just the ones from unpkg. Note
      that Aspen is still the recommended way of loading your Vue JS files.</p>

    <link-header id="breaking">Breaking Changes</link-header>

    <link-header small id="entry-points">
      Entry points must now be explicitly declared</link-header>

    <p>
      In previous versions, VueDart's transformer would try to infer which of your
      Dart entry points (e.g. scripts containing a <code>main()</code> declaration)
      required VueDart to be run. However, this was a buggy, error-prone process,
      so now the <code>entry_points</code> must be explicitly declared in your
      transformer configuration:</p>

    <pygments class="yaml">
- vue2:
    entry_points:
      - web/index.dart
    </pygments>

    <p>As mentioned above, the VueDart CLI will take care of this change for you.</p>

    <link-header small id="name-positional">
      The component name being passed to <code>VueComponent</code> is now a named
      parameter</link-header>

    <p><b>TL;DR:</b> Instead of this:</p>

    <pygments class="dart">
@VueComponent('my-component')
    </pygments>

    <p>You now need to do this:</p>

    <pygments class="dart">
@VueComponent(name: 'my-component')
    </pygments>

    <p>
      Again, this is a minor change, and the CLI will automatically migrate your code.
      (It's worth noting that this very website was migrated using the CLI, because
      I didn't want to go through all 12 components and change it manually.)
      It was necessary in order to allow a component to be unnamed (for VueRouter
      support).</p>

    <link-header id="fixes">Bugfixes</link-header>

    <link-header small id="errors">Errors instead of crashing</link-header>

    <p>
      In many cases before, when there was a bug in your Dart components, VueDart's
      transformer would crash. Obviously, this is a very bad thing, so VueDart 0.3
      will show proper errors in these situations.</p>

    <link-header small id="multiline">
      Multiple data/prop declarations on one line no longer crash the transformer
      </link-header>

    <p>Before, stuff like this would crash the transformer:</p>

    <pygments class="dart">
@prop
String myFirstProp, mySecondProp;
    </pygments>

    <p>
      Now, it works much like you'd expect: it declares multiple props on one line.
      Same goes for <code>@data</code>, too.</p>

    <link-header id="notes">Miscellaneous notes</link-header>

    <p>
      The VueDart docs have been reorganized a bit, and since the site now uses
      Aspen, there shouldn't be any more problems with external upgrades on
      CDN-hosted items screwing with the website.</p>

    <p>
      A <i>lot</i> of time and effort has gone into this release, and I hope you
      enjoy it! Happy Darting! (<i>Is that even a thing? That's totally not a
      thing...)</i></p>
