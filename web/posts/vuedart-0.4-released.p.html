    <p>
      After almost a year, I'm happy to <i>finally</i> be able to announce VueDart 0.4! It's
      got Dart 2.0 support, a ton of great changes, a
      <a href="https://refi64.com/vuedart">new website</a>, and more. This is definitely a much
      bigger release than even 0.3 was!

  <link-header id="redesign">Website redesign</link-header>

  <p>
    First off, since cosmetics are obviously the most important part of a web framework (/s):
    the website has undergone a <i>complete</i> redesign, built on top of
    <a href="#vdmc">vdmc</a> and VueDart 0.4.</p>

  <p>
    Here's some pictures for comparison (they're in pairs: first comes the old,
    then the new design):</p>

  <link-header id="changes">Major changes</link-header>

  <link-header small id="dart-2.0">Dart 2 support</link-header>

  <p>
    VueDart 0.4 comes with first-class Dart 2 support. pub is no longer supported, and everything
    has been moved over to <code>package:build</code>. This caused some major changes in the
    way VueDart transforms code, which led to several other changes that will be mentioned
    below.</p>

  <p>
    That being said, the immediate change is that you'll no longer be using <code>pub</code>
    to build and serve your projects. Instead,
    <a href="https://webdev.dartlang.org/tools/webdev">webdev</a> is taking its place.</p>

  <link-header small id="vue2">vue2 is now vue</link-header>

  <p>
    The package names <code>vue2</code> and <code>vue2_cli</code> are now just <code>vue</code>
    and <code>vue_cli</code>, respectively. Huge thanks to <b>@emilniklas</b> for
    <a href="https://github.com/emilniklas/vue-dart/issues/2#issuecomment-350628985">letting
      me use it</a>!</p>

  <link-header small id="mixins">Mixins</link-header>

  <p>Mixins have undergone two major changes.</p>

  <p>First up: all mixins must now have <code>implements VueMixinRequirements</code>:</p>

  <pygments class="dart">
@VueMixin()
class MyMixin implements VueMixinRequirements {
  // ...
}
  </pygments>

  <p>The other change is that there is no longer a mixins: argument to VueComponent:</p>

  <pygments class="dart">
// Before
@VueComponent(
  // ...
  mixins: const [MyMixin],
)
// Notice the mixins are given twice: the mixins: argument above only takes VueDart mixins
class MyComponent extends VueComponentBase with MyMixin
  </pygments>

  <p>
    Of course, the problem was you could forget to put the mixin in both places properly.
    Now, you just need to put it inside the <code>with</code> clause and drop the
    <code>mixins:</code> argument.</p>

  <p>
    As one other bonus, mixins can now be passed to <code>VueApp</code>, not just
    <code>VueComponent</code>.</p>

  <link-header small id="global-register">Components are no longer globally registered
    </link-header>

  <p>Before, component registration was a bit like this:</p>

  <pygments class="dart">
@VueComponent('my-component', template: '&lt;&lt;')
  </pygments>

  <p>Now, it's like this:</p>

  <pygments class="dart">
@VueComponent(template: '&lt;&lt;')
  </pygments>

  <p>Wait, what? Where did the component name go?</p>

  <p>
    In VueDart 0.4, no components are globally registered. Instead, they must be passed to the
    components/apps using them, just like in vanilla Vue. For example:</p>

  <pygments class="dart">
@VueComponent(template: 'stuff here')
class MyComponent extends VueComponentBase {
}

@VueComponent(template: '&lt;my-component/&gt;',
              // Have to pass MyComponent to say it's being used
              components: [MyComponent])
class MyOtherComponent extends VueComponentBase {
}

@VueApp(id: '#app', components: [MyOtherComponent])
class App {
}
  </pygments>

  <p>The primary benefit is better tree-shaking.</p>

  <p>
    If you have a lot of components that you frequently use, you can put them all in a mixin:</p>

  <pygments class="dart">
@VueMixin(components: [MyComponent, MyOtherComponent])
class MyMixin implements VueMixinRequirements {}

@VueComponent(template: '&lt;my-component&gt;')
class MyThirdComponent extends VueComponentBase with MyMixin {}
  </pygments>

  <p>
    As a side note, one nice new feature of Dart 2 is that you no longer need to prefix
    the type lists with <code>const</code> like you did for the old mixins.</p>

  <link-header small id="boilerplate">No more constructor boilerplate</link-header>

  <p>
    You may noticed something interesting about the above examples: the constructor boilerplate
    from before (<code>Component(context): super(context)</code> and the whole factory dance)
    are now completely gone! However, as a side-effect of this, you can no longer use the
    constructor as the <code>created</code>. Instead, a
    <a href="#lifecycle">proper method override has been added</a>.</p>

  <link-header small id="lifecycle">Lifecycle hook renaming</link-header>

  <p>All the overridable lifecycle methods now are prefixed with <i>lifecycle</i>:</p>

  <pygments class="dart">
// Before
@override
void mounted() {}

// Now
@override
void lifecycleMounted() {}
  </pygments>

  <p>
    In addition, as mentioned above, there's now a <code>lifecycleCreated</code> hook.</p>

  <link-header small id="events">Type-safe event API</link-header>

  <p>
    The primary way of handling events in Vue is via
    <code>v-event:event=&quot;handler&quot;</code> (or <code>@event=&quot;handler&quit;</code>).
    However, it offers another method, via <code>$emit</code>, <code>$on</code>,
    <code>$off</code>, and <code>$once</code>.</p>

  <p>
    If this seems familiar, it's because this is basically a JavaScript/Vue version of Dart's
    streams. VueDart now has a type-safe API for interacting with events that utilizes these
    streams! Here's an example:</p>

  <pygments class="dart">
@VueComponent(template: '&lt;button @click=&quot;_clicked&quot;&gt;Button&lt;/button&gt;')
class MyButton {
  // The event spec.
  static final buttonClicked = VueEventSpec&lt;int&gt;('button-clicked');

  // The sink is used to emit events, and the stream is used to receive them.
  VueEventSink&lt;int&gt; buttonClickedSink;
  VueEventStream&lt;int&gt; buttonClickedStream;

  @override
  void lifecycleCreated() {
    buttonClickedSink = buttonClicked.createSink(this);
    buttonClickedStream = buttonClickedStream.createStream(this);
  }

  @method
  void _clicked() =&gt; buttonClickedSink.add(DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch);
}

@VueComponent(template: '&lt;my-button ref=&quot;button&quot;&gt;&lt;/my-button&gt;',
              components: [MyButton])
class MyOtherButton {
  @ref
  MyButton button;

  @override
  void lifecycleMounted() {
    // Receive events
    button.buttonClickedStream.listen((time) {
      print('Clicked at $time');
    });
  }
}
  </pygments>

  <link-header small id="sass">Sass support</link-header>

  <p>You can now use Sass inside your component styles:</p>

  <pygments class="html">
&lt;template vuedart&gt;
  &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;style scoped lang=&quot;sass&quot;&gt;
  p {
    background-color: purple;

    :hover {
      background-color: blue;
    }
  }
&lt;style&gt;
  </pygments>

  <link-header small id="model">Model support</link-header>

  <p>Models are now supported via <code>@model()</code>:</p>

  <pygments class="dart">
@model(event: 'my-event')
@prop
int someProp = 0;
  </pygments>

  <link-header id="bugfixes">Bugfixes</link-header>

  <link-header small id="bool">bool props work properly</link-header>

  <p>
    Before, if you created a <code>bool</code> prop, it would end up being assigned the empty
    string instead of true and null instead of false. This now works properly.</p>

  <link-header small id="optional">Methods can take optional arguments</link-header>

  <p>
    This "worked" under Dart 1.0, but it was actually never supposed to. VueDart 0.4 now
    implements this properly.</p>

  <link-header id="plugins">Plugin-related work</link-header>

  <link-header small id="router">VueRouter changes and VueAppOptions</link-header>

  <p>
    When you pass components to VueRouter, you must now use <code>ComponentName()</code>
    instead of <code>#ComponentName</code>.</p>

  <p>
    In addition, a new API for passing miscellaneous options to the Vue JavaScript constructor
    has been added, called <code>VueAppOptions</code>. VueRouter has been adapted to use this
    new API: instead of the previous way of passing the router to your app, pass it via
    <code>app.create(options: [router])</code>.</p>

  <link-header small id="material">VueMaterial is now considered legacy</link-header>

  <p>
    The built-in VueMaterial support has been moved to
    <code>package:vue/plugins/vuematerial_legacy</code>. It was never past VueMaterial 0.8,
    and future work in Material Design support is going towards <a href="#vdmc">Vdmc</a>.</p>

  <link-header id="cli">CLI work</link-header>

  <link-header small id="versioning">Version numbers now align with VueDart</link-header>

  <p>
    The versioning system now matches the corresponding VueDart version. For instance, vue_cli
    0.4 will generate VueDart 0.4 projects.</p>

  <link-header small id="migrate">The migrate command is now unsupported</link-header>

  <p>
    It was a cool idea that never actually worked that well and could wreck stuff easily.
    It's still there, but you probably shouldn't be using it.</p>

  <link-header id="next">What's next?</link-header>

  <p>
    Unfortunately, due to the...chaos that went into this release (fun fact: wiping out your
    home partition is <i>not</i> fun), there were some things that didn't quite make it in, or
    aren't polished to the extent that I want. This will likely come to the next VueDart version,
    most likely 0.5 (though the Aspen parts may come to a 0.4.1, if it were to be released).</p>

  <link-header small id="aspen">Aspen rework</link-header>

  <p>
    Aspen still has to be run manually via the command line. This sort of made sense when
    pub was a build system, but now with <code>package:build</code>, as well as the new focus on
    vdmc, it's a <b>disaster</b>. Therefore, the goal is to rework Aspen to be a builder. In
    addition, it may will generate Dart code rather than direct JavaScript.</p>

  <p>
    The main benefit will come from being able to use generated outputs as assets. In addition,
    you won't have to worry about forgetting to run it! It'll also be more easily used by vdmc.
    Speaking of vdmc...</p>

  <link-header small id="vdmc"><b>V</b>ue<b>D</b>art <b>M</b>aterial <b>C</b>omponents
    </link-header>

  <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/kirbyfan64/vdmc">Vdmc</a> is an early WIP set of wrappers over
    <a href="https://matsp.github.io/material-components-vue/">Material Components Vue</a>,
    which is in turn a set of wrappers over
    <a href="https://material.io/develop/web/">Material Components for Web</a>. This basically
    means that, soon, VueDart will have a full set of wrappers over the official Material Design
    components! I was hoping this would be ready for prime time by now, but more work needs to be
    done. In particular, I want it to properly use the new, coming-soon Aspen for assets and have
    actual documentation.</p>

  <p>
    That being said, you can already see how it looks via the
    <a href="#redesign">VueDart website redesign</a>.</p>

  <link-header small id="compilation">Compiling component templates</link-header>

  <p>
    This is my personal main target for 0.5. Right now, component template HTML is inserted
    directly into the code and compiled at runtime. I want 0.5 to have a template compiler
    like normal Vue does, which would actually compile the HTML templates into Dart render
    functions (though better render function support is probably going to come in the pipeline
    first).</p>

  <link-header small id="vuex">Vuex</link-header>

  <p>Yes, this got delayed again. It will come...eventually...</p>
